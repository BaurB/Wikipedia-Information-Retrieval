# Wikipedia-Information-Retrieval
The aim of the project is to learn about Natural Language Processing and analyze the content from the Wikipedia article. The project is divided into the following steps:
* Retrieve content from selected Wikipedia article
* Extract meaningful and usable content by removing markups, the URLs and any useless words or characters
* Clean up and filter the data to narrow the scope to relevant words
* Build a simple frequency model.
* Visualize most frequent words and analyse the article based on the model
